Thanks for buying the Ajax PriceSlider Module.

Installation Steps:

1. Drop the app-skin folders in your magento installation folder. 
2. Go to YOUR_THEME_CHANGES, if you haven't changed your theme yet, you can drop the page and catalog folders on yourtheme/template folder.

If you already have a customized theme:

you will find the page/1column.phtml 2columns-left.phtml 2columns-right.phtml and 3columns.phtml.  You can see the code changes between commented lines.
The catalog/product/list/toolbar.phtml and page/html/pager.phtml files are like the default ones, but for all the <select> boxes remove the [onchange="setLocation(this.value)"] code.
Finally, replace your catalog/layer/filter.phtml file with the file provided. 
You should logout and login again to access the configuration section of the extension, there you can set the step value for the price slider.

After that, do not forget to refresh your Magento cache. If any doubt or comment, please do not hesitate to contact us.
